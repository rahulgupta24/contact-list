# Calculator and Contact List React App

This is a simple React application that includes two components: a realistic calculator and a contact list. The calculator allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations, and the contact list allows you to manage a list of contacts. The contact list interacts with a mock API to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on contacts.

## Calculator

### Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Clear the input and result.
- Calculate and display the result.
- Handle errors in case of invalid expressions.
- Added a backspace (delete) button for removing the last character.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the calculator.

## Contact List

### Features

- Fetch a list of contacts from a mock API (JSONPlaceholder) when the component mounts.
- Add new contacts and display them in the list.
- Update existing contacts.
- Delete contacts.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine (if you haven't already).

2. Navigate to the project directory (if you're not already there).

3. Install the required dependencies (if you haven't already).

4. Start the development server (if you haven't already).

5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the Contact List.

### Note

- The contact data is fetched from the JSONPlaceholder API, so you need an internet connection to fetch and update contact data.
- This is a front-end-only application, and the data is not permanently stored. It's used for demonstration and learning purposes.
